## What is Auto-Teleport?

Auto-Teleport is our **intelligent fund management system** that automatically handles DOT transfers between supported chains when you make a purchase.

### The Problem It Solves

**Before Auto-Teleport:**
❌ NFTs on AssetHub, but DOT on Relay Chain  
❌ Manual transfers required  
❌ Complex chain switching  
❌ Failed transactions due to insufficient funds on target chain  

**With Auto-Teleport:**
✅ **Click buy** - that's it!  
✅ **System handles** transfers automatically  
✅ **Single transaction** from your perspective  
✅ **Zero-friction** user experience  

## How Auto-Teleport Works

### Current Functionality

**Supported Networks:**
- **Polkadot Relay Chain** ↔️ **Polkadot AssetHub**
- **Kusama** ↔️ **Kusama AssetHub**

### The Magic Behind a Purchase

**Example Scenario:**
1. **You want to buy an NFT** for 12 DOT on AssetHub
2. **You have funds** on Polkadot Relay Chain but not enough on AssetHub
3. **Auto-teleport activates:**
   - Detects you need funds on AssetHub
   - Automatically teleports DOT from Relay Chain to AssetHub
   - You only sign **one transaction**
   - Purchase completes seamlessly

### User Experience
