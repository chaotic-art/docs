## Why Shopping Cart Matters

### The Old Way (Painful)
❌ Buy one NFT at a time  
❌ Pay network fees for each purchase  
❌ Risk price changes between purchases  
❌ Slow and inefficient process  
❌ High total transaction costs  

### The Chaotic Way (Genius)
✅ **Add multiple NFTs** to your cart  
✅ **One transaction** for everything  
✅ **Lower total fees** via batch processing  
✅ **Lock prices** while shopping  
✅ **Bulk discount opportunities**
