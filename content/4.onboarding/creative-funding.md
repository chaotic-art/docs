Chaotic offers creative funding to selected artists for their drops, supporting strong ideas and artists with an active and visible audience. Funding amounts are modest and meant to support creation, visibility, and experimentation.

Artists are selected after an internal team review. If you are interested, please reach out to the [Chaotic team](https://t.me/Just_Luuuu) or join our public [Telegram channel](https://t.me/chaoticapp). Funding is processed after final artwork delivery, and the Chaotic team prepares the drop. Currently, we focus mainly on generative artists.

## Artist Expectations

Each artist receiving funding agrees to:

- **Complete artwork** — Submit final work for the drop, following all technical and content requirements.
- **Artist bio document** — Provide a short bio including the story and inspiration behind the work, the creative process, basic information about the artist, and links to socials and previous work. This content will be published as a Medium article.
- **Social promotion** — Actively promote the drop on personal social channels.
- **X/Twitter posts** — Share posts related to the drop, tagging [@chaoticapp](https://x.com/chaoticapp) and Polkadot. Posts can include work-in-progress, creation process, animations, story behind the art, drop information, collages of minted NFTs, or different variations of the artwork.
- **Ongoing promotion** — Continue promoting the drop regularly until it sells out or the campaign ends.
- **Community engagement** — Join the [Chaotic community on Telegram](https://t.me/chaoticapp) and engage naturally. No link spamming.
- **Collector interaction** — Be available to interact with collectors and respond to comments during the drop.
- **Feedback** — Share feedback with the Chaotic team and basic results after the drop.
- **Visibility support** *(optional but recommended)* — Examples include a small competition, giveaway, bonus drop, or any creative activity that helps bring attention to the artwork.
