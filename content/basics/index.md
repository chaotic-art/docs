# Team 🌀

Chaotic is built by a passionate team of degens, builders, and visionaries who believe NFTs should be accessible, fun, and profitable for everyone.

## Core Team

### The Builders
Our team comes from diverse backgrounds in blockchain development, design, and community building. We're united by our shared vision of creating the best NFT experience in the Polkadot ecosystem.

We're not just building a marketplace - we're creating a **public good** that benefits the entire Polkadot community. Every feature we ship, every innovation we create, goes back into strengthening the ecosystem.

## Community-Driven Development

### Open Source Philosophy
