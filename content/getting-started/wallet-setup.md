# Wallet Setup 💰

## Account Security First

Your seed phrase is your **key to everything**. Lose it = lose your NFTs and DOT forever.

**DO:**
- ✅ Write it down on paper (multiple copies)
- ✅ Store in a secure location (safe, bank vault)
- ✅ Never share with anyone
- ✅ Test restore process with small amount first

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Screenshot or save digitally
- ❌ Share via messages/email
- ❌ Store in cloud services
- ❌ Tell anyone your seed phrase
