# Shopping Cart

> The first NFT marketplace with a proper shopping cart system - buy multiple NFTs in one transaction

## Why Shopping Cart Matters

### The Old Way (Painful)

❌ Buy one NFT at a time<br />


❌ Pay network fees for each purchase<br />


❌ Risk price changes between purchases<br />


❌ Slow and inefficient process<br />


❌ High total transaction costs

### The Chaotic Way (Genius)

✅ **Add multiple NFTs** to your cart<br />


✅ **One transaction** for everything<br />


✅ **Lower total fees** via batch processing<br />


✅ **Lock prices** while shopping<br />


✅ **Bulk discount opportunities**
